# Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Dashboard (2010–2025) — Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Data (2010–2025)** using **Power BI** to uncover insights about EV adoption, regional performance, and powertrain trends. The goal is to transform raw EV data into an **interactive and insightful dashboard** that supports data-driven decision-making and sustainability analysis.

## Objective
- Identify **top regions** contributing to global EV growth.  
- Compare **performance across categories** — Cars, Buses, Trucks, and 2-Wheelers.  
- Analyze **powertrain adoption trends** (BEV, PHEV, FCEV).  
- Study **year-over-year sales and stock growth** from 2010 to 2025.  
- Visualize **energy consumption** and stock relationships.
  

## Data Preparation
- **Dataset Source:** IEA Global EV Data (2010–2025)  
- **Records:** 12,000+ rows with 8 key fields — Region, Category, Parameter, Mode, Powertrain, Year, Unit, and Value.  
- Cleaned and transformed using **Power Query Editor**:  
  - Removed duplicates and null values  
  - Standardized text formats (e.g., BEV, PHEV)  
  - Fixed data types and unit consistency  


## Data Modeling & DAX Measures
Custom DAX measures were created to enable advanced analytics:  
- **Total EV Value** → Total EV stock/sales  
- **YoY Growth %** → Year-over-year growth  
- **Cumulative EV Stock** → Global adoption trend  
- **BEV vs PHEV Ratio** → Powertrain comparison  
- **Dominant Combo per Region** → Top mode–powertrain pair  


## Dashboard Design
**Pages in Dashboard:**  
1. Regional & Category Trends  
2. Powertrain & Mode Insights  
3. Parameter & Unit Analysis  
4. Time-Series & Comparative View  

**Visuals Used:** Line Charts, Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Tables, and Slicers  
**Filters:** Year and Category  

## Key Insights
- **China** leads globally in EV stock and sales.  
- **Europe** shows the fastest growth rate post-2020.  
- **Cars (BEV)** dominate globally, while **2-wheelers** grow rapidly in Asia.  
- **BEVs** have overtaken **PHEVs** since 2018.  
- **Energy consumption** increased **4× since 2015**, showing rapid adoption.  


## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard & Visualization  
- **Power Query** – Data Cleaning  
- **DAX** – Custom Measures  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data Source  


##  Conclusion
The analysis highlights the exponential rise of Electric Vehicles and the dominance of **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** driven by innovation and affordability.  
This Power BI project demonstrates how **data storytelling** can simplify complex data into meaningful insights supporting **sustainability and strategic decisions**.
